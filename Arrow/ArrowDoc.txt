Standardizing in-memory data
    Zero-overhead memory sharing between libraries in-memory and processes via shared memory.
    Reuse algorithm
    Reuse I/O storage code


Although the Tables(SQL/Hive)/DataFrames(Python/R/Spark) have the same name(Table and DataFrame), but internally they 
are represented in different data-structures. The is no common standard which is followed between them.


Pandas are built on Numpy NdArrays



Apache Arrow is an open standard language-independent standard for in-memory columnar data (tables/dataframes)


Non Portable DataFrames(R/Python/JVM) -> We can't use the data between different languages
Portable DataFrames (Arrow)
