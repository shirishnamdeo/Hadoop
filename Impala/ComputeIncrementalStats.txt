COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity partition(reporting_year=reporting_year); 
-- How this is working? How 'reporting_year=reporting_year' is evaluating and executing? Isn't this dynamic? Is it computing the STATS for the whole table?


I thought only the below can work.
COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity partition(reporting_year='2019');


compute incremental stats int_partitions partition (x < 100);
compute incremental stats int_partitions partition (x in (100, 150, 200));
compute incremental stats int_partitions partition (x between 100 and 175);
compute incremental stats int_partitions partition (x in (100, 150, 200) or x < 100);
compute incremental stats int_partitions partition (x != 150);



show column stats t1;

show table stats item_partitioned;
