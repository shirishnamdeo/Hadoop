SHOW TABLE STATS  <table_name>;
show column stats <table_name>;
COMPUTE STATS     <table_name>;

SHOW PARTITIONS   <table_name>;

COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS <table_name>;
DROP INCREMENTAL STATS    <table_name>;

For a particular table, use either COMPUTE STATS or COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS, but never combine the two or alternate between them. 
If you switch from COMPUTE STATS to COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS during the lifetime of a table, or vice versa, drop all statistics by running DROP STATS before making the switch.
