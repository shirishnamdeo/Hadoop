DECIMAL[(precision[, scale])]

CREATE TABLE decimals_11_8(x DECIMAL(11, 8));

-> precision represents the total number of digits that can be represented regardless of the location of the decimal point.
   This value must be between 1 and 38, specified as an integer literal

-> scale represents the number of fractional digits.

-> range of DECIMAL type is -10^38 +1 through 10^38 â€“1. 

The largest value is represented by DECIMAL(38, 0).
The most precise fractional value (between 0 and 1, or 0 and -1) is represented by DECIMAL(38, 38), with 38 digits to the right of the decimal point.
The value closest to 0 would be .0000...1 (37 zeros and the final 1). 
The value closest to 1 would be .999... (9 repeated 38 times).


Memory and disk storage:
Only the precision determines the storage size for DECIMAL values, and the scale setting has no effect on the storage size.
