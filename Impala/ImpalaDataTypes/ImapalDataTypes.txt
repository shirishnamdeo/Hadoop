Impala supports a limited set of implicit casts to avoid undesired results from unexpected casting behavior:
    Impala does not implicitly cast between string and numeric or Boolean types. Always use CAST() for these conversions.

    Impala does perform implicit casts among the numeric types, when going from a smaller or less precise type to a larger or more precise one. 
    For example, Impala will implicitly convert a SMALLINT to a BIGINT or FLOAT, but to convert from DOUBLE to FLOAT or INT to TINYINT requires a call to CAST() in the query.

    Impala does perform implicit casts from STRING to TIMESTAMP. Impala has a restricted set of literal formats for the TIMESTAMP data type and the FROM_UNIXTIME() format string.


TINYINT  -> 1-byte (-128 .. 127)
SMALLINT -> 2-byte (-32768 .. 32767)
INT      -> 4-byte ( -2147483648 .. 2147483647)
BIGINT   -> 8-byte (-9223372036854775808 .. 9223372036854775807)
