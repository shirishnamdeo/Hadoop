Why this query is not working?
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity SELECT * FROM dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity;

Table: dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity is partitioned on reporting_date.
ERROR: AnalysisException: Not enough partition columns mentioned in query. Missing columns are: reporting_year

Seems like if table is partitioned then we need to overwrite every like:
insert overwrite table target_table partiton(<partition spec>) select * from stg_table;  
-- Why not all partitions can be overwritten at once?
