A column-oriented DBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that stores its content by column rather than by row. 
This has advantages for data warehouses(how??) and library catalogues where aggregates are computed over large numbers of similar data items.

Analytic use-cases almost exclusively use a subset of the columns in the queried table and generally aggregate values over a broad range of rows. 
This access pattern is greatly accelerated by column oriented data. 
Operational use-cases are more likely to access most or all of the columns in a row, and might be more appropriately served by row oriented storage. 
A column oriented storage format was chosen for Kudu because it’s primarily targeted at analytic use-cases.
