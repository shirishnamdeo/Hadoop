-- So even though I am giving alias name to every field, when inserting into core table if the select and inset has diferent order then everything is messed up. 

Answer:
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity(
a,
b,
c,
d)
SELECT
    d AS d ,
    b AS b ,
    a AS a ,
    c AS c 
FROM dhtax_tp_clientrevenue_equity_stg;  

Why Impala insert into the incorrect columns? I have read in some articles that the order matters in Impala, irrespective of the alias name I give to attributes in SELECT query. 
Yes - only order matters. You can call them whatever you want in SELECT. So giving an alias name is of no use in IMPALA.
 

***** Solution: ONly solution is to select the data in the order in which you needs to insert into the target table. *****
