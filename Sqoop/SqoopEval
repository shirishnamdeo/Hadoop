The eval tool allows users to quickly run simple SQL queries against a database; results are printed to the console. This allows users to preview their import queries to ensure they import the data they expect.



Both sqoop eval or sqoop-eval can be used



Sample Query: 

sqoop-eval --connect "jdbc:oracle:thin@//PLNLOD2026-SCAN.eu.hedani.net:1552/PLNL16800.WORLD" --username "username" --password "password" --query "select distinct(bus_date) from SPC_FV.FV_TRADE_DATA_LAKE_VIEW"

Can also be written in steps:
sqoop eval \
--connect connectionstring \
--username username \
--password password \
--query query




Sqoop eval give the output in the same format as, the database server would have given to the database GUI. Column headers, + the data. While when 
we use sqoop import only the row is being inserted into the file
