A non-relational (NoSQL) database that runs on top of HDFS.
Hbase is column family oriented db. --
Data can be retreived quickly or batch processed with mapreduce.


Hbase use case:
--Variable columns , --some column will appear, sone wont appear.
--high throughput
--random read/write

--if someone say, I have a petabyte of data, and want to read all the data of a table at one, than this is NOT a good use case for HBASE.




Apache HBase is an open source NoSQL database that provides real-time read/write access to those large datasets.

HBase scales linearly to handle huge data sets with billions of rows and millions of columns, and it easily combines data sources that use a wide variety of different structures and schemas. HBase is natively integrated with Hadoop and works seamlessly alongside other data access engines through YARN.



HBASE Architecture:

Region servers are placed on top of each datanode, and are responsibe for storing data, getting data, running scans ..

--Region servers writes locally to the machine(datanode), and then data will do around to another machines.

--Hbase master is on namenode and responsibe for doing all the coordination
--ZooKeper ?
